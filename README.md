You can call me whatever you'd like but I mostly go by Dottie or anybody I'm copelinked with :33 </br> <br/> I'm almost always off-tab unless I'm with friends (so like maybe 2 people) but feel free to interact or cuddle, If I take a while you can always whisper me, chances are It'll get my attention more ! Guaranteed I'm not the best at conversations with newer people but it's nothing personal <br/> <br/> I'd rather get to know someone first before being friends, so if you add me randomly and I have no clue who you are, you'll most likely get declined,, <br/></br> I'm usually sitting around the bakery somewhere, mostly the front or just whereever my friends are!

$${\color{#3cb371}BeforeㅤYouㅤInteract}$$ — I'm very shy and take a while to think of what to say when it comes to acquaintances or new people in general, no ill-will, just nervous. I'll listen in to what you want to talk about, I just will have small responses or give a few gestures (nodding, booping, etc.) </br> </br> If there's something I'm doing wrong or just makes you uncomfy, let me know and I'll refrain from doing so! Same goes for cosplays/fits, if I'm cosplaying somebody from a piece of media you don't like then you can tell me and I'll change immediately! </br></br> I'm slow, so you might need to be direct with or explain to me in more detail with whatever we're talking about </br> </br> I don't really care much for what types of jokes you say or do; flirting, insulting, dirty, satirical, brainrot, etc. All those types of humor just as long as it's within reason, not taken too far, and that everybody knows you're joking </br> </br> I'm a [copelinker](https://rentry.co/xindrome), I'm just never too open about it

$${\color{#cd5c5c}DoㅤNotㅤInteract}$$ — [Basic DNI](https://basic-dni.crd.co/) </br> ex-friends/partners </br> anti system/fictkin/irl </br> refusing to use tonetags at all, or not explaining if you're srs or joking </br> if you're the type to bash on peoples interests in a srs matter without giving a good reason why (cringe is NOT a reason)
